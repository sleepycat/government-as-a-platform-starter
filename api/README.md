# Government As A Platform: The API

Focusing on the frontend in the GaaP model is missing moon while looking at the finger. The API is the main event.
This is a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) API. Graphql is chosen here because of its composability, [legibility](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility) and for the way it enables both security and security automation.

### Running the API

```sh
# install the dependencies
npm install
# start the api
npm start
```

### Running the tests

```sh
npm test
```
